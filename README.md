# Music-Recommender-System

Background of the Problem:
For companies which have business in the domains such as media streaming, e-commerce, it is important to know what content its customers might like. Having a recommendation system can help the provide a personalized experience to a customer by making personalized recommendations.

In this project, we can leverage customer data from last.fm to build recommendation systems that can provide personalized recommendations using listening history and / or user information such as user age, location, gender, etc.

Apart from building a recommendation algorithm, I have also used this project to introduce myself to Apache Spark. I have used ALS tool from pyspark to build a matrix factorization based recommendation algorithm. Apart from this algorithm, I also use k-means clustering to aggregate data based on usersâ€™ age, gender and country to make crude recommendation for users without any listening history.
